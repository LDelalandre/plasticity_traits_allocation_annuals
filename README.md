### ITV - plasticity - genet - traits

This repository contains the code used for the article "Intraspecific responses to nutrient deficiencies: the key role of plasticity in biomass allocation to roots".

You can clone the repository with git by pasting in your terminal:

	git clone https://github.com/LDelalandre/dimensionality_life_cycle.git
    
or 
just download the repository:

# Structure of the scripts
- import_data
- boxplot_in_situ: within-species trait variation in situ (boxplots and tests)
- origin_ferti_effects: mixed model to test the effects of origin and fertilization on trait values in the experiment
